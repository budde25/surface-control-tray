# Surface Control Tray

Tray program for controlling various aspects of the Mircrosoft Surface Book 2 from the tray.  
Thanks to the incredible work https://github.com/linux-surface/surface-control for the surface control command line tool. This tray would not be possible without it, as most of the code for actually controlling the device is from the CLI, I simply put a gui over it.  
Note: As I only have a surface book 2 that is the only device that I have been able to test it on, Also detach funtionality is not working at the moment.
